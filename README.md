# la-metro-live-map_app

This Flask app provides users with a real-time visual representation of train positions across the Los Angeles metro system. By leveraging the LA Metro open data API, the app pulls train coordinates and overlays them onto a MapTiler map of LA. The current version of the app displays the A (Blue) and C (Green) lines. With this app, users can track train movements and plan their commutes accordingly.
